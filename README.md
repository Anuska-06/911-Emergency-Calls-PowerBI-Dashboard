#  911 Emergency Calls Dashboard â€“ Power BI Project

This Power BI project analyzes 660K+ emergency call records to uncover patterns in EMS, Fire, and Traffic incidents across zip codes in Montgomery County, PA. The goal is to help emergency services optimize response strategies, resource allocation, and preparedness based on call volumes, time trends, and geographic hotspots.
